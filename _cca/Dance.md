<h4>Objectives</h4>
<p>The Dance CCA started in 2022, following the amalgamation of Chinese Dance
and Malay Dance CCAs. It aims to amplify students’ interest in dance through
the mastery of diverse dance genres from classical to contemporary, jazz
and hip hop, and instill resilience and discipline alongside other school
values in them. With a structured intensive program that teaches skills,
improvisation techniques and choreography and platforms to perform, we
hope to bring out the best in each of our dancers and nurture them with
the qualities that would carry them through their academic and non-academic
pursuits.</p>
<h4>Main Activities</h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Exercises for body core strengthening as well as cardiovascular and muscle
conditioning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choreography in preparation for school-based performances, including Morning
Assembly, Open House and National Day concerts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trainings for Singapore Youth Festival 2024.</p>
</li>
</ol>
