<h3>Co-Curricular Activities</h3>
<p>CCA is an important part of our students’ holistic education and development.
CCA enables students to realise their potential by providing them with
opportunities to discover their interests and talents. In Beacon Primary
School, we aim to cultivate in our students the joy of learning so that
they are motivated to pursue their interests and talents in the long run.
Our CCAs also emphasise social interaction by providing a common space
for friendships and social integration amongst students of diverse backgrounds.</p>

<h4>CCA Policy</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students are encouraged to actively participate in one CCA from P3 onward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students must have at least 75% of attendance to constitute a member of
any CCA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students should not be absent from CCA without a valid reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are strongly encouraged to remain in their CCA throughout their
primary school journey. This is to provide an opportunity for progression
and allow time for students to develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills,
values and attitudes through sustained participation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Change of CCA</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students may request for a change of CCA only at the end of P3. Once the request is approved, students will join the new CCA in the following academic year.
<br>
<br>For parents who would like to request for change of CCA, please click
on the link below and print the Change of CCA Form. Parents are to fill
up the form accordingly with the reason(s) clearly stated. Thereafter,
students will submit the form to their Form Teachers. Students will remain
in the current CCA until the change has been approved.
