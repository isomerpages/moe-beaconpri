<h4>Objectives</h4>
<p>The Percussion CCA seeks to inculcate students’ interests in the performing
arts by participating in music events at both non-competitive and competitive
levels. The performing aspect helps students to build confidence when they
express themselves and communicate with the audience through percussion
music. The learning process of playing in an ensemble also develops teamwork,
resilience and the spirit of excellence.</p>
<h4>Main Activities</h4>
<p>Students are trained by professional instructors to play a selection of
percussion instruments using the correct technique. To help build up and
strengthen students’ proficiency level, practice sessions include various
rhythmic pattern playing using drumming techniques. From rhythmic exercises
to traditional and contemporary (including fusion) performing pieces, Percussion
CCA offers a rich and engaging cultural experience for the students.</p>
