<h4>Objectives</h4>
<p>Art Club offers students with interest in visual arts an avenue to come
together and hone their artistic talent through meaningful art experiences.
Student-artists get to explore new art techniques, expand their knowledge
in art and cultivate their spirit of creativity, innovation, and experimentation
through art.</p>
<p>Through teacher-led activities, the Art Club aims to enable students to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Be able to express their feelings appropriately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persevere to commit to complete each task to the best of their abilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn to cooperate with others to achieve the same goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be able to critique their own work and the work of their peers and established
artists in positive and constructive ways.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Main Activities</h4>
<p>Sessions are planned and guided by the Studio Habits of Mind framework.
Student-artists develop their craft through the exploration of traditional
art mediums and unconventional materials. The teacher-led sessions are
scaffolded for students to visually conceptualise ideas, enabling them
to express their thoughts, imagination and emotions. Some examples of activities
include batik painting, paper weaving, printmaking, tie-dye, clay sculpting,
digital art, outdoor drawing, and learning journey to art museums. The
Art club also participates actively in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival
(SYF) Visual Arts Exhibition.</p>
