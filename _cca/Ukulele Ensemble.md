<h4>Objectives</h4>
<p>The Ukulele Ensemble CCA aims to nurture students with the passion for
the performing arts through an instrumental ensemble. Students will learn
the basic techniques of ukulele-playing and develop sight-reading and ensemble
skills. The CCA also seeks to nurture confidence in students and provide
opportunities to hone showmanship skills, while inculcating discipline,
teamwork and resilience through performances in school events.</p>
<h4>Main Activities</h4>
<p>Sessions are planned and guided by professional instructors. The ukulele
sessions encompass all aspects of ukulele playing, including chord reading,
strumming and plucking patterns, and melody playing (ranging from tunes
of popular songs to classical music) arranged for ukulele. Through the
CCA, students interact and bond amongst teams, combining the playing of
chords and melodies to songs. By learning a musical skill together, students
can have fun through the learning process.</p>
