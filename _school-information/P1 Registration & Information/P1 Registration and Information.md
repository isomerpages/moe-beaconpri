<h3>P1 Registration and Information</h3>
<p>In line with the measures announced by the Government to further enhance
safe distancing measures and ensure minimal contact among the public, there
will be no in-person registration at schools for P1 registration. You may
register your child online in a phase as long as you fulfill at least one
of the requirements for that phase.</p>
<p>You may wish to refer to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MOE P1 Registration website</a> for
updates on the P1 Registration Exercise.</p>
