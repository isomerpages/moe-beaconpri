<h3>School Rules And Practices</h3>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<h4>School Rules</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Students must adhere to the school's Code of Conduct and school rules.
There will be disciplinary actions for infringement of the school rules
and general conduct. The school will take the necessary actions in the
best interest of our students, school staff and the community.</p>

</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>Students who are Singapore Citizens must stand at attention when singing
the National Anthem and taking the Pledge. Students will take the Pledge

<p><strong>Importance of Punctuality</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>It is important that students develop the good habit of being punctual
for school. They should come prepared to start a new school day after a
good night's sleep and proper breakfast. The canteen is open for breakfast
for those who are early.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who arrive after 7.30 am are considered late. When students arrive
late, they will miss essential instructions given at the beginning of the
day. Students who are late also feel uncomfortable entering classes when
lessons have already started. The following is the process to discourage
students from developing the unhealthy habit of being late for school:

</ol>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students who are absent from school must produce a medical certificate
or letter from parents/guardians to state the reason(s) for their absence.
Absence from examination/test must be supported with a medical certificate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students' attendance will be marked by teachers using School Cockpit mobile.
An alert, via SMS, will be given to parents at 9.30 am if students are
not in school. The time of alert is to provide allowance for students who
could have been late for school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are not allowed to miss school during school term. The school
does not have the authority to grant leave for students to miss school.
Students should not be away from school before the school holidays or report
school late when term has started. Only exceptions such as bereavement
and serious illnesses of immediate family members will be considered.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Communication</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Communication via email to school staff are encouraged. Staff email addresses
are given in introductory letters and are available on school website.
They may also be contactable through GO at 6769 7255.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All school communication and information will be updated through Parents
Gateway (PG). Any changes of parents' email addresses or contact details
must be updated through PG.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delivering of messages or things (such as books, food, or stationery)
to the students are to be avoided to avoid disruption of lessons in class.
Students may borrow money from the GO when they forget to bring money for
recess or lunch, and return the money the next day. Staff in the GO will
contact parents on such requests made by the students.</p>

<p><strong>Photographs and Video Images</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Please take note that photographs or video images of students or their
legal guardians may be taken during school activities and events. The school
may use and publish such photographs or video recordings in official channels
e.g. school publications and the school website. We would advise parents
not to upload photos or videos taken of school or students on other social
media platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Birthday Gifts in school</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The school strongly discourages celebration of students' birthday in school
by providing food and gifts for the classmates. We are concerned about
food allergies/ restrictions and unhealthy comparison among children, especially
when their birthday gifts to their friends are not reciprocated. The school
encourages birthday celebrations at home with loved ones and friends.</p>

</ul>
<ol start="4" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Oral Digital Thermometers (ODTs)</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students are required to bring their ODTs to school daily and ensure that
their ODTs are in good working condition at all times. Students will need
to purchase new ODTs if theirs are lost or spoilt. They are to replace
the batteries of the ODTs when necessary. ODTs are available from the school
bookshop. Tips for taking your temperature and taking care of your thermometers:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check your thermometer to see if it is working.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace the batteries if they are weak.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clean the tip of the thermometer before you use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Record your temperature in the handbook.</p>
