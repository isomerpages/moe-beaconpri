##### Lunch Schedule for CCA Days

To accommodate staggered lunch timings, lessons will end at 2 pm for P4 to P6 students. On Thursdays without CCA, all students will be dismissed at 1.30 pm.

##### Recess

Recess timings are staggered to reduce congestion and to have smaller groups of students. The timings for recess will not be the same for each day due to the constraints of the timetable. The schedule is as follows:
