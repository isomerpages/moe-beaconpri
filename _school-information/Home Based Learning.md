<h4>Support for Teacher-Student Live Interaction Sessions</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Your child's teachers would be conducting live lesson or interaction sessions
on HBL days. The teachers will be specifying the live session timing on
the HBL instructions. To support the the sessions your child should prepare
the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Headphones/earphones</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Microphone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Web camera</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Live Session Applications</strong> 
<br>Please assist your child with setting up the following applications to
allow the use of a microphone and camera:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><a href="https://meet.google.com/?pli=1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Google Meet (web-based)</a> -
Log in with your child's Google Suites account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://hangouts.google.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Google Hangouts (web-based)</a> -
Log in with your child's Google Suites account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://zoom.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Zoom</a> -
Create an account using your child's Google Suites account. Download the
application for easier usage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As teachers continue to innovate and introduce other web-based applications
(Kahoot, Nearpod, Quizziz, etc.) for lessons, we seek your understanding
and patience in guiding your child to navigate these applications.</p>
<p><strong>Live Session Etiquette</strong> 
<br>During live sessions, your child should also observe the following etiquette:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Be ready 5 minutes before</strong> the specified time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be dressed appropriately</strong> in <strong>PE shirt</strong> (not
topless or pyjamas)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clear background</strong> with no distracting posters, photos or
undergarments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hair</strong> should be neat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Face</strong> should be <strong>clearly seen</strong>, not covered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use hand signals</strong> as instructed by the teachers (thumbs
up, down, 1 ,2, 3 etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mute the microphone</strong> unless they need to speak</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Avoid chatting</strong> with others in the background</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please advise other members of the household to be mindful of their behaviour
while your child is in a live session. As other students in the live session
can see and hear what is happening in the background, please take additional
care when walking past your child, live session etiquette mentioned above
should be adhered by other family members.</p>
<p><strong>Recording of Live Sessions</strong> 
<br>Please note that live sessions may be recorded to support others who are
unable to join in at the specified time.</p>
