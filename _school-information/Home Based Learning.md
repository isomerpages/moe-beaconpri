<h3>Home-Based Learning</h3>

will be assigned by teachers to ensure continuity of learning. These activities
include videos, textbook reading, workbook tasks, online work, etc.</p>
<h4>HBL Instructions</h4>
<p>You may access the HBL Site for learning activity instructions. The site

<h4>Support for Teacher-Student Live Interaction Sessions</h4>
<p>Your child's teachers would be conducting live lesson or interaction sessions
on HBL days. The teachers will be specifying the live session timing on
the HBL instructions. To support the the sessions your child should prepare
the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Headphones/earphones</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Microphone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Web camera</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Live Session Applications</strong> 
<br>Please assist your child with setting up the following applications to
allow the use of a microphone and camera:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><a href="https://meet.google.com/?pli=1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Google Meet (web-based)</a> -
Log in with your child's Google Suites account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://hangouts.google.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Google Hangouts (web-based)</a> -
Log in with your child's Google Suites account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://zoom.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Zoom</a> -
Create an account using your child's Google Suites account. Download the
application for easier usage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As teachers continue to innovate and introduce other web-based applications
(Kahoot, Nearpod, Quizziz, etc.) for lessons, we seek your understanding
and patience in guiding your child to navigate these applications.</p>

<br>During live sessions, your child should also observe the following etiquette:</p>
