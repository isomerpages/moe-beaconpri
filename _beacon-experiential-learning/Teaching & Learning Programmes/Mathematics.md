<h3>Mathematics</h3>
<h4>Department Vision</h4>

<img style="width: 100%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/BEL/math_framework.png">
</div>
<p>The Mathematics Department aims to enable all students to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>acquire mathematical concepts and skills for everyday use and continuous
learning in mathematics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application, and metacognitive
skills through a mathematical approach to problem-solving</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build confidence and foster interest in mathematics</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve these objectives, teachers strive to make mathematics simple,
thoughtful, and fun for all students.</p>

<p><strong>SimpleMaths</strong>: Teachers adopt a variety of teaching approaches
to simplify the learning of mathematics. Through the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract
approach, students acquire mathematical concepts and skills. As problem-solving
is central to mathematics learning, students learn Polya’s 4 essential
steps – Understand, Plan, Solve, and Check – to solving problems. In addition,
ICT is meaningfully infused into lessons for students to explore, collaborate
and deepen their learning.</p>

<p><strong>ThoughtfulMaths</strong>: Teachers nurture a classroom culture
that allows students to develop thinking, reasoning, and metacognitive
skills. Students are given the opportunities to communicate, reason and
reflect on their mathematical thinking. Teachers lead and guide students
to explore and make sense of the Mathematical concepts on their own so
they can build new ideas. This allows them to become more confident and
participative over time.</p>

<p><strong>FunMaths</strong>: Students learn better through play. The use
of physical and digital manipulatives allows the students to actively participate
in the learning process and allow them to discover and understand mathematical
concepts. During our Beacon Experiential Week (BEx), we had the opportunity
to embed games and stories into our lessons. This enabled the students
to discover and apply Mathematical skills and concepts in a real-world
context.</p>
<h4>Excellence 2000 (E2K) Mathematics Programme</h4>
<p>&gt;&gt; Insert E2K photos here</p>
<p>The E2K Mathematics programme caters to selected Primary 4 and 5 students
who demonstrate added interest and ability in Mathematics. It offers opportunities
for students to collaborate with their peers and engage in mathematical
thinking through resources such as puzzles, games and explorations which
are specifically designed to hone their mathematical skills. Through these
rich learning experiences, students will develop the habits, attitudes
and disposition that mathematicians possess, as well as gain important
21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking, and
effective communication skills.</p>
<h4>Mathematics Olympiad Training</h4>
<p>Primary 4 to 6 students who are talented and passionate about Mathematics
are invited to join the Maths Olympiad training. These training sessions
help them to think critically and creatively in problem-solving. Students
will be given the opportunity to apply what they have learnt in Mathematics
competitions such as the Singapore and Asian Schools Maths Olympiad (SASMO),
Asia-Pacific Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools (APMOPS), Raffles
Maths Olympiad (RMO) and National Mathematical Olympiad Singapore (NMOS).
This will allow them to gain exposure beyond the school apply the concepts
they have learnt.</p>
<h4>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)</h4>
<p>&gt;&gt; Insert LSM photos here</p>
<p>The LSM programme provides early intervention support in acquiring basic
numeracy skills for identified Primary 1 to 4 students. In a small group
setting, trained teachers make use of a variety of strategies such as scaffolding
and visual representation to help deepen their understanding of the concepts
learnt.</p>
