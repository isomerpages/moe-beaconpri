<h3>Aesthetics</h3>
<h4>Art</h4>
<p>Our Art programme at Beacon Primary aims to enable every child to enjoy
art, communicate visually and make meaning through connecting with society
and culture. Students will either work individually or in groups during
art lessons to create, observe, explore, communicate, reflect and collaborate.</p>

<p>Beacons learn through authentic art learning experiences such as the drawing
module and putting together a class art exhibition, bringing about shared
memories of their art learning experiences.</p>

<p>Beacons experience singing to a wide range of repertoire. For example,
they learn local and global songs, popular trending songs and folk songs
through creative movement and singing games.</p>
