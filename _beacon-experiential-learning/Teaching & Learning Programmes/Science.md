<h3>Science</h3>
<p>The vision of the Science Department at Beacon Primary School aims to
cultivate students' natural inclination towards inquiry. Children possess
an inherent curiosity and eagerness to explore their surroundings. Our
science programme harnesses and nurtures this spirit of curiosity through
experiential learning. We strive to develop students who not only enjoy
science but also recognise its value as an essential tool for exploring
the natural and physical world.</p>
<p>The school's diverse learning environments, which include our pond, garden
and science discovery rooms, provide excellent spaces for students to engage
in hands-on activities that deepen their understanding of scientific concepts.</p>

<h4>Excellence 2000 (E2K) Science Programme</h4>
<p>The E2K Science Programme is an enrichment initiative designed for Primary
4 and 5 students who demonstrate exceptional interest and aptitude in science.
Through inquiry-based scientific investigations, students discover and
deepen their understanding of advanced scientific concepts. The programme's
enriching learning experiences help develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions
characteristic of scientists, while fostering essential 21st-century competencies,
including critical and inventive thinking, and effective communication
skills.</p>
<h4>Beacon GREENS Programme</h4>
<p>The Beacon GREENS programme is our special programme that makes use of
our newly built aeroponic and hydroponic green space to offer students
a hands-on experience to learn the science behind modern soil-free farming
methods. This innovative facility promotes sustainable urban farming by
conserving water, reducing spatial requirements and improving plant growth
efficiency.</p>

<h4>Science Festival â€“ Ignite!: Where Ideas Catch Fire.</h4>
<p>The Science Department's annual science festival, "Ignite!: Where Ideas
Catch Fire", offers students a dynamic platform to showcase their inventive
capabilities, critical thinking and problem-solving skills through the
practical application of scientific concepts to real-world challenges.
Through the Beacon CREATES process, students develop their ability to identify
problems, generate ideas and craft meaningful solutions, whilst strengthening
essential 21st-century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking,
collaboration and communication skills. The festival culminates in presentations
where students demonstrate their innovative solutions and articulate their
ideas to an audience.</p>
