<h3>English Language</h3>
<h4>GLOW STELLAR</h4>
<p>In Beacon, the learning of English is designed with the idea of Grow,
Learn, Own and Wonder (GLOW). This is achieved through the school-based
STELLAR (Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading) programme
and packages that promote curiosity to enhance students’ growth and their
acquisition of speaking, writing, and presenting skills.</p>
<p>GLOW is conducted in a media-rich environment that harnesses the affordances
of technology to allow students to take ownership of their learning. Even
at the lower primary, students learn to curate and present information
using digital media platforms such as blogs and presentations slides. This
culminates in students becoming effective and confident communicators,
who are ready for the 21st century.</p>

<h4>Digital Storytelling</h4>
<p>Using Digital Storytelling (DST), Primary 1 and 2 students create and
share their narratives with their classmates. Students plan out their stories
during English lessons and craft out their own characters during Art lessons.
The stories are then brought to life using animations and narration. Their
masterpieces are then showcased in a gallery for their peers to enjoy and
learn from.</p>
<h4>Science in STELLAR (SiS)</h4>
<p>Science in STELLAR (SiS) introduces and weaves the learning of Science
into English lessons. Conducted from Primary 1 to 4, students learn about
science concepts through thematic books taught in the respective levels.
Students get to observe, discuss and conduct fun and simple experiments.
These lessons develop students’ confidence and provide them with opportunities
to work as a team to develop their communication and reasoning skills.</p>

<h4>Readers' Delight</h4>
<h5>Raz-Kids</h5>
<p>Raz-Kids is an online tiered reading platform. Aside from physical books,
students in Beacon are also exposed to e-books. Here, emergent readers
can listen to books being read to them while proficient readers go on to
more advanced skills like retelling a story, reading books at an advanced
level and completing quizzes tagged to the e-books. Students will constantly
be delighted as the platform provides a wide range of genres and titles
to choose from.</p>
<h5>Voracious Reader</h5>
<p>To encourage students to develop a love for reading, students are scheduled
to go to the library weekly to explore and enjoy a wide range of reading
materials. Working hand in hand with the Mother Tongue department, students
are monitored for their readership. Top readers both in the classrooms
and across the levels are recognised on a termly basis as Champion Voracious
Readers.</p>
<h5>Library Fortnight</h5>
<p>Each term, the Beacon Library highlights different topics to encouraged
students to be more engaged in their subjects in a fun way. During Library
Fortnight, students get to interact with subject specific manipulatives
and online resources to deepen their interest in the subject. For example,
during a Science showcase, students may be engaged in discovering more
about how solar power can be harnessed to reduce carbon emission while
for Physical Education, students could be asked to research notable sports
personalities.</p>

<h4>Literature Appreciation Programme</h4>
<p>Literature Appreciation Programme (LAP) aims to spark students’ interest
in exploring literature texts through developing the students’ critical
appreciation of text and promoting positive human experiences through various
literary forms like poetry, drama and literature texts. Through these literary
forms, our students develop a greater sense of self-awareness and sensitivity.</p>
<p>The following are texts that have been selected to engage the students:</p>

<h4>Spelling Bee</h4>
<p>In Beacon, students are challenged to widen their vocabulary and improve
on their spelling through the annual Spelling Bee. Students from Primary
1 to 4 participate in a series of spelling activities that culminate in
the finals of the Spelling Bee. These activities inject an element of fun
and healthy competition to promote good spelling and widened vocabulary.</p>

<h4>Storytelling Festival</h4>
<p>The Beacon Storytelling Festival provides opportunities for our students
to share their love for storytelling with their peers. Through their creativity
and the skilful use of their voice, gestures and self-made props, our Primary
1 to 5 storytellers draw their audience into their stories. As the students
listen to these stories, they also learn about moral values as depicted
in Aesop’s fables and virtues in the fairy tales that are shared with them.</p>

<h4>Literacy Support Programme</h4>
<p>Learning Support Programme for English (LSE), School-based Dyslexia Remediation
Programme (SDR) and Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) are specialised
intervention programmes aimed at providing support to students who need
additional help in literacy skills.&nbsp; LSE is conducted at Primary 1
and 2 while SDR and RRP are conducted at Primary 3 and 4.</p>
<h4>Read with Me Programme</h4>
<p>Read with Me is a reading programme aimed at building students’ reading
fluency and promoting a positive attitude towards reading. Students practise
their reading using STELLAR books and levelled readers from the Peter and
Jane series. Conducted daily before school, each student is paired with
a buddy who journeys with them as they achieve automaticity and fluency
in word recognition.</p>
