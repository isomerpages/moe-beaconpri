<h3>ICT at Beacon</h3>
<p>The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in Beacon Primary
School is integrated into the teaching and learning programmes. The school
aims to develop every Beacon to achieve their highest potential, with the
spirit of creativity and innovation.</p>
<p>ICT at Beacon adopts a 3-stage model, segmenting the student population
into 3 levels: lower, middle and upper primary. At the three levels, learning
tasks are designed within the school's curriculum to incorporate the explicit
learning of New Media Literacies (NML) and its abilities to <strong>Curate</strong>, <strong>Create</strong> and <strong>Connect</strong>.</p>
<h4>Lower Primary - Learn to Use</h4>
<p>Students in the lower primary are introduced to ICT tools and basic skills
in using the devices and their applications. Some of these skills include
account management, web navigation, using search engines, etc.</p>

<h4>Middle Primary - Use to Learn</h4>
<p>With the basics of being learnt, students in the middle primary engage
in more independent learning tasks such as research and journaling. Students
also learn to engage in online platforms that allow them to collaborate
and connect with their peers.</p>

<h4>Upper Primary - Use to Create</h4>
<p>Upper primary students will engage in projects that allow them to extend
their learning based on their own interests, taking part in online discussion
forums with their classmates and exchanging ideas, and creating content
for their peers and the community.</p>

<h4>New Media Literacies</h4>
<p>New Media Literacies are defined as the competencies to create, connect
and curate information in the digital networked environment. Regular engagement
in these interactions will enable students to develop an understanding
of the social practices (tacit norms and skills) governing the Web and
be equipped with the knowledge and skills to navigate and participate productively.
At the heart of these interactions are the six core values of the 21st
Century Competencies (21CC) framework, that anchor the learning experiences
and promote discerning and responsible use of technology.</p>

<h4>Digital literacy and competencies</h4>
<p>In accordance to EdTech Masterplan 2030, one of the key strategic thrusts
is to strengthen the development of studentsâ€™ digital literacy and technological
skills. This is to ensure that students are well-equipped with the digital
competencies to thrive in an increasingly technology-saturated future.</p>
