<h3>Programme for Active Learning</h3>
<p>The Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is an integral part of the curriculum
for Primary 1 and 2 students. PAL offers learning experiences that are
active, hands-on, and meaningful. PAL consists of modules with activities
in four domains – Sports &amp; Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts,
and Visual Arts. These activities, which are carried out in school within
the curriculum time, are designed to facilitate the development of social
and emotional competencies.</p>
<h4>Sports and Games</h4>
<p>During Sports and Games lessons, students have the opportunity to engage
in games and practise responsible decision making when they discuss and
decide on rules to ensure a fair and safe game. Students are also taught
empathy and how to engage different senses as they learn about inclusiveness
in sports.</p>

<h4>Outdoor Education</h4>
<p>The Outdoor Education module is designed to engage students in activities
involving outdoor elements such as pitching a tent and exploring the eco
garden. Students will also get the opportunity to take up an active role
in taking care of the environment through the adoption of a plant and observe
the changes over time.</p>

<h4>Performing Arts</h4>
<p>Through the Performing Arts module, students are exposed to a variety
of drama, dance and music activities that give them opportunities to discover
themselves and show care and consideration for others when making decisions
as a group.</p>
<h5>Drama</h5>
<p>Through well-known fairy tales like “The Little Red Riding Hood”, students
take on the perspectives of others and learn to appreciate diversity using
drama strategies such as ‘Hot Seat’ and ‘Freeze Frame’.</p>

<h5>Music</h5>
<p>Using classical instruments, students reflect upon the sounds made by
different instruments to identify the emotions associated with the music.
Students also learn to work in groups to create rhythms with musical instruments
such as the handbells, shakers and everyday items like cups and plates.</p>

<h4>Visual Arts</h4>
<p>Through a series of art stories told through drawings, shapes and colours,
students get to learn how to recognise and label emotions so as to enable
them to know their friends better and respond in appropriate ways when
listening to different viewpoints.</p>
