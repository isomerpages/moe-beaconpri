<h3>Beacons SHINE for Life: Learn, Experience, Live</h3>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) in Beacon is more than just
learning the values; it is a continuous journey of discovering one’s best
self. By infusing our SHINE Values into the schools’ learning experiences,
Beacons strive to</p>

<h4>SHINE Values</h4>
<p>Beacon’s SHINE values drive all character development programmes. The
school explicitly aligned the SHINE values to the Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE) learning outcomes and emphasised on having a common language
when delivering CCE curriculum content and experiences. Every Beacon aspires
to be a Contributor, Connector, Constructor, Conductor and a Confident
Learner. Through the SHINE values lessons, students and teachers explore,
reflect and practice on how to be a SHINE-ing Beacon in our daily activities
and actions.</p>

<h4>CCE Curriculum Content</h4>
<p>The curriculum content of CCE is based on the three big ideas of Identity,
Relationships, and Choices, and comprises the teaching and learning of
core values, and social-emotional competencies with a focus on developing
a sense of purpose in Beacons. Through the curriculum content areas such
as Cyber Wellness (CW), Mental Health (MH), Sexuality Education (SEd),
Family Education (FE), National Education (NE) and Education and Career
Guidance (ECG), every Beacon has the opportunity to develop a sense of
purpose, identity, belonging, personality and passion in growing into their
unique self.</p>

<h4>Enactment of CCE</h4>
<p>There are several learning platforms where CCE is enacted with intentionality.
These include CCE Lessons during curriculum time, planned student development
learning experiences beyond the classroom, teachable moments during other
subject lessons and learning opportunities beyond school.</p>
<h4>CCE Lesson</h4>
<p>These lessons which include CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP), CCE
Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) and Programme for Active Learning (PAL) provide
the time for teachers to engage and build relationships with their students
through discussions and effective classroom strategies. Broadly, there
are three ways CCE lesson time is used:</p>
<p>i) <strong>explicit teaching of values</strong>, and social and emotional
skills addresses the holistic developmental needs of students, e.g. CCE
(FTGP) / CCE (MTL),
<br>iii) equip students with <strong>knowledge and skills</strong> to better
understand and navigate the real world,
<br>ii) provide <strong>opportunities for contribution</strong> to family, school
and community through VIA projects and leadership tasks.</p>

<h4>Sexuality Education</h4>

<p>Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional
changes as they grow up and develop healthy relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality
matters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and others
by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality that

</ul>

<h4>Enhancing Social Emotional Learning through Executive Functioning Skills</h4>
<p>Executive Function (EF) refers to a set of skills that are essential for
learners to develop the capacity to plan ahead and meet goals, display
self-control, follow multi-step directions and stay focused despite distractions.
This forms a foundation for self-regulation to help children build social-emotional
skills and prepare them for learning. Beacon customises and designs lessons
to build EF skills in a progressive manner. Classroom practices and school
routines are platforms for students to practise these EF skills daily to
ensure consistency.</p>
