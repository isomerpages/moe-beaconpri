<h3>Beacon Teaching and Learning (T &amp; L) Framework</h3>
<p>Beacon Primary Teaching and Learning Framework serves as a guide for teachers
to design and deliver teaching and learning experiences that are relevant,
coherent, effective and maximise student learning.</p>
<p>Our main focus is to achieve the schoolâ€™s Vision and Values. We believe
in developing the Character of our students as the strong foundation for
success. To achieve this, teachers give attention to the Content, Pedagogy,
Assessment and Experiences that we carefully craft for our students.</p>
<p>A Caring and Enabling Environment provides the backdrop to which staff
and students interact with one another and within oneself, showing respect,
care and encouragement to motivate us to do our best. We encourage our
teachers to refer to the T &amp; L framework as they plan and review their
lessons, striving to make improvement and achieving purposeful outcomes.</p>
