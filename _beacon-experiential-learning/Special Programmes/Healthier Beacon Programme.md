<h3>Healthier Beacon Programme</h3>
<p>Healthier Beacon is our whole-school wellness initiative designed to help
students build healthy habits that will last a lifetime. We believe that
when students eat well and stay active, they feel better, learn better,
grow up stronger and happier.</p>
<p>This programme makes healthy living fun and exciting for our students.
They can earn tokens for finishing their meals, especially their fruits
and vegetables, and for taking part in fun activities during recess, like
jump rope, traditional games, and simple movement challenges.</p>
<p>Each month, we celebrate the class with the most tokens with a special
fruit platter. At the end of each term, the top class in every level will
be named our Healthiest Class, and every child in that class will receive
a special prize like a reusable water bottle or healthy snack pack.</p>
<p>To support this effort, we’ve also created colourful murals in the canteen
to teach students about healthy eating and staying active in a fun and
engaging way.</p>

<p>At Beacon Primary, we care deeply about students’ well-being. Healthier
Beacon is just one of the many ways we create a caring, vibrant environment
where students shine – both in the classroom and beyond.</p>
