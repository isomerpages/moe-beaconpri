<h3>Making in Education at Beacon Primary</h3>
<p>At Beacon Primary, we give focus to Making in Education as we recognise
that students are able to derive valuable knowledge, skills and values
through hands-on activities. The process of designing and making allow
students to acquire critical thinking, problem-solving and collaboration
skills. These are necessary 21st Century Competencies to manage evolving
challenges in life.</p>
<p>Besides emphasising experiential learning in daily teaching and learning
lessons, the school also specially set aside a <strong>Beacon Experiential Learning Week</strong> for
more focused learning in the aspect of making. During this week, all learning
opportunities are designed for learning to take place through making experiences.
The activities in Beacon Experiential Learning Week are reviewed each year
for improvement.</p>
<p>In the problem-solving process, the students go through the process of <strong>Beacon CREATES</strong> to
develop the required skills in identifying issues and arriving at an appropriate
solution. The process in Beacon CREATES are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>C </strong>– consider different aspects of the issue
<br><strong>R </strong>– redefine for better understanding
<br><strong>E </strong>– examine and establish possible approaches to manage
the issue
<br><strong>A </strong>– arrive at the best solution
<br><strong>T </strong>– test the solution
<br><strong>E </strong>– evaluate outcomes and make changes
<br><strong>S </strong>– Share learning with others</p>
<p>Beacon CREATES is an iterative, non-linear process that focuses on finding
the best solution to an identified issue.</p>
<p>Some of the interesting activities carried out during Beacon Experiential
Learning Week include the following:</p>
