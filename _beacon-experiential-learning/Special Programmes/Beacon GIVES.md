<p>Beacon GIVES provides a platform for our Primary 6 to engage in a Student-initiated
effort to give back. They take charge of planning, organizing, and executing
the event. Through this initiative, they learn entrepreneurial skills,
teamwork, and social responsibility as they:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Create handmade crafts and upcycled items to sell</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Curate a collection of pre-loved items for sale</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Promote their booths through creating a website where they have to curate

<p>This meaningful fundraising event empowers our students to show empathy,
take initiative, and make a difference in the lives of the less fortunate.
In addition, the hands-on experience nurtures the values of generosity,
empathy, volunteerism, and innovation while strengthening class spirit
and sportsmanship.</p>
