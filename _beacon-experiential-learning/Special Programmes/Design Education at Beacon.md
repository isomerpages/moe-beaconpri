<h3>Design Education at Beacon</h3>
<p></p>
<p>At Beacon Primary, we give focus to Design Education as we recognise that
students can derive valuable knowledge, skills and values through hands-on
activities. The process of designing allows students to acquire critical
thinking, problem-solving and collaboration skills. These are the necessary
21st Century Competencies to manage evolving challenges in life. Through
the intentional development of 21st-century competencies, students will
achieve our <a href="https://www.beaconpri.moe.edu.sg/about-us/cvndo/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">student outcomes</a> as
effective <strong>Constructors </strong>who seek solutions with curiosity
and resourcefulness, and <strong>Conductors </strong>who lead and inspire
others as role models</p>
<p>Besides emphasising experiential learning in daily teaching and learning
lessons, the school also specially set aside a Beacon Experiential Learning
Week for more focused learning in the aspect of Design Education. The activities
in Beacon Experiential Learning Week are reviewed each year for improvement.</p>
<p>The school adopts a three-tiered approach to Design Education, illustrating
how learning is progressively deepened and personalised for students. At
the base of the pyramid, the Broad-based Curriculum provides all students
with age-appropriate exposure to design education and problem-solving.
Through subjects and programmes such as Science, CCE, VIA and Ignite, students
apply design processes to real-world contexts, developing foundational
skills in creativity, collaboration and critical thinking. The middle tier
comprises Special Programmes, which offer deeper learning and engagement
to students. At the top tier, the Makerspace CCA supports students with
strong interest and aptitude, offering extended opportunities to innovate
with purpose, participate in competitions, show leadership and translate
ideas into impactful solutions.</p>

<p>Across all tiers, students apply the Beacon <strong>IDEA </strong>framework
(<strong>I</strong> – Inquiry, <strong>D</strong> – Develop, <strong>E</strong> –
Execute, <strong>A</strong> – Advance) to develop key 21st century competencies,
including critical, adaptive and inventive thinking, communication and
collaboration skills. Through these experiences, students are supported
to take ownership of their learning while developing important dispositions
such as empathy, human-centricity, curiosity, open-mindedness and resilience.</p>
<p>Some of the interesting activities carried out during Beacon Experiential
Learning Week include the following:</p>
