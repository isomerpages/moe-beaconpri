<h3>Makerspace @ Beacon</h3>
<p>Makerspace@Beacon was established to enable students to bring their ideas
to life. With a focus on problem-solving and experiential learning, teachers
act as facilitators, guiding students as they acquire new skills and transform
their ideas into reality.</p>
<p>Participation in the Makerspace is open to both selected students, based
on interest and ability, and a wider group by integrating Makerspace activities
into various co-curricular activities (CCAs). This approach allows students
to develop basic making skills while enhancing their CCA experience through
hands-on creation.</p>
