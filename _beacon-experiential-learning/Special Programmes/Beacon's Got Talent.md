<h3>Beacon’s Got Talent (BGT)</h3>
<p>Beacon’s Got Talent (BGT) is a showcase of our young talents’ creation
in various arts form. From designing BGT logos, creating audition videos
to choreographing and executing a dance, song or instrument performance,
BGT provides an authentic learning platform for all our students whether
they are performers or audience. Selected performances from the audition
videos will perform in school during Beacon Experiential Week to win level
prizes and also perform at the annual Beacon’s Cultural Celebration and
Family Day.</p>
