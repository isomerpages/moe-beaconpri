<p>Thank you for visiting our school website. You will be able to catch glimpses
of the enjoyable learning experiences we provide at Beacon Primary. Each
day, we look forward to our students entering the school gate with anticipation
of meeting with their teachers and friends and having a fruitful day of
learning in school.</p>
<p>Learning for both staff and students comes in different forms, starting
with the interactions we have with the people around us and our responses
to the learning opportunities offered each day. We understand that each
one learns differently. We hope that our varied learning platforms and
myriads of programmes and activities meet the different learnersâ€™ needs.</p>
<p>We hope that you are captivated by the happy faces through our school
website and intrigued to know more about what we do in Beacon Primary.
Do come to visit us at our physical Open House on Saturday, 31 May 2025.</p>
<p>Happy Reading!</p>
