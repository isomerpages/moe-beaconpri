<h3>Message From School Leaders</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you for visiting our school website. You will be able to gather
information on what we stand for and the learning opportunities we offer
to both students and staff in our school. Please visit our page on Event
Gallery and enjoy the delightful faces of students and staff in the various
activities that we had. We will be holding our physical Open House on 29
June 2024. Do look out for details nearer the date and join us on this
day.</p>
<p>Our focus has always been to provide meaningful learning experiences for
our students and staff. We want students and staff to be motivated in their
daily encounters and be inspired as they reflect upon the memories of time
well spent. We give emphasis to responsible use of resources as we consider
the harm done to the environment.</p>
<p>We aim to nurture good learning habits and a resilient attitude (Constructor
and Conductor) in our students, help them to develop empathy and a heart
for others (Contributor and Connector). We hope that the meaningful and
positive learning experiences in Beacon Primary will instill the confidence
(Confident Learner) in our students that they should be able to ride the
storms ahead of them.</p>
<p>We look forward to another great year of learning and growing together
as a school community.</p>
<p>Happy Reading!</p>
