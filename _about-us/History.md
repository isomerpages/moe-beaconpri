<p>Beacon Primary School was the first new primary school set up as part
of the FutureSchools@Singapore (FS@SG) programme. This programme was a
collaboration between the Ministry of Education (MOE) and Infocomm Development
Authority (IDA) to effectively harness the benefits of technology for engaged
learning.</p>
<p>The name ‘Beacon’ was first made public on 21 May 2007 as part of the
official announcement of the FS@SG programme. It was chosen to signify
the school’s important role as a vanguard in charting new directions and
providing possible models to engage students in learning by leveraging
technology, thus preparing them for a complex and an ever-changing global
environment.</p>
<p>The conceptualisation and planning process for the school started in early
December 2006, when our then Principal, Miss Lim Boon Cheng, was appointed
and the first wave of pioneer teachers was recruited. The school team worked
with MOE HQ officers to develop programmes that would address the holistic
development of the students who will be functioning in a future that demands
skills in diverse domains. Beacon registered the first batch of students
during the 2007 Primary One Registration Exercise. A total of 240 places
in 8 P1 classes were offered and fully taken up. The school started operations
in its brand new premises on 2 January 2008. Beacon Primary School was
officially opened on 23 July 2010.</p>
<p>Although MOE has officially concluded the FutureSchools@Singapore Programme
in 2014, Beacon Primary continues to build upon our strengths in promoting
critical and creative thinking through innovative approaches in the school.</p>
